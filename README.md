# Oxocard Connect with BMP280 Sensor
Oxocard NanoPy adaption of BMP280 temp/pressure sensor with display output

Connect a BMP280 sensor via I2C to the Oxocard. I used a Oxocard Connect with Breadboard.

Thanks to the micropython library of David Stenwall (david at stenwall.io), which helps 
me to adapt it NanoPython.
